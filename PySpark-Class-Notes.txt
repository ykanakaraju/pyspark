  Spark
  -----

    => Spark is in-memory distributed computing framework for big data analytics.

	in-memory: ability to persist intermediate results in RAM and subsequent operations
		   can directly work on these persisted intermediate results. 

    => Spark is written in Scala programming language

    => Spark is a polyglot
	-> Scala, Java, Python, R (and SQL)

    => Spark applications can run on:
	-> local, Spark standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes

    => Spark is unified analytics framework.
	

  Spark Unified Framework
  -----------------------

    Spark provides a consistent set of APIs for performing different analytics workloads
    using the same execution engine and some well defined data abstractions and operations.

	Batch Analytics			-> Spark SQL
	Streaming Analytics (real time)	-> Structured Streaming, DStreams API
	Predictive analytics (ML)	-> Spark MLLib  (mllib & ml)
	Graph parallel computations  	-> Spark GraphX


  Getting started with Spark
  -------------------------- 

   1. Setting up local dev environment

	Ref URL: https://github.com/ykanakaraju/pyspark/blob/master/Pyspark-JupyterNotebooks-Windows-Setup.pdf  
	Spark download: https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html


   2. Databricks Community Edition (preferred)


  Setting up PySpark on Windows machine
  -------------------------------------

	1. Install Java 8 or up

		java -version
		
		https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk24-windows

	2. Add JAVA_HOME environment variable

		Go to 'Edit system environemt variables' windows
		Add JAVA_HOME env. variable with the PATH were Java is installed.

	3. Download and extract Spark binaries.

		URL: https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html
		Choose the version
		Download spark: <click on this link>
		Go to the mirror site and download


		-> Extract the downloaded file in a suitable folder
		(tar -xvf <path-of-tgz file>)

	4. Add SPARK_HOME environment variable

		Go to 'Edit system environemt variables' windows
		Add SPARK_HOME env. variable with the PATH were Spark is extracted.

	5. Setup Hadoop winutils for windows 

		URL: https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils
		Download the repo
		Extract it and copy the folder to your Spark path. 

	6. Add HADOOP_HOME environment variable

		Go to 'Edit system environemt variables' windows
		Add HADOOP_HOME env. variable with the PATH were hadoop is extracted.

	7. Add the "bin" folders of the above to the PATH environment variable

		%JAVA_HOME%\bin
		%SPARK_HOME%\bin
		%HADOOP_HOME%\bin

	8. Open a command terminal and type spark-shell

		C:> spark-shell

	9. Download and install Python (3 or above)

	10. Pip install find-spark library for python

		pip install findspark

  Spark Architecture
  ------------------

	1. Cluster Manager (CM)
		-> Applications are submitted to CMs
		-> Allocates containers for lauching driver and executors on the cluster. 
		-> Spark supports multiple CMs
			-> local, standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes		

	2. Driver
		-> Master process
		-> Runs the 'SparkContext' object
		-> Manages the user code and sends the tasks to the executors as per the code. 

		Deploy Modes:
		  -> Where to run the driver process
		  1. Client : default, driver runs on the client. 
		  2. Cluster: driver runs on one of the nodes on the cluster.

	3. SparkContext
		-> Is an application context
		-> Starting point of execution
		-> Is the link between the driver and tasks running on the executors

	4. Executors
		-> Receives the tasks from the Driver
		-> All tasks run the same code but on different partitions of the data
		-> The status of tasks are reported to the driver.
