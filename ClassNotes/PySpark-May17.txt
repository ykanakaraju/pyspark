   Spark
   -----
       	-> Spark is a unified in-memory distributed computing framework.
	-> Used for big data analytics

	-> Spark is written in "Scala" language.

	-> Spark is a polyglot
		Supports  Scala, Java, Python, R


   Spark Unified Framework
   -----------------------

	Spark provided a set of consistent APIs based on the same execution engine to process different
	analytics workloads. 

		Batch Processing of unstructured data	=> Spark Core API (RDDs)
		Batch Processing of structured data	=> Spark SQL
		Stream processing (real time)		=> Structured Streaming, DStreams API
		Predictive analytics (ML)		=> Spark MLLib
		Graph parallel computations		=> Spark GraphX



    Getting started with Spark
    --------------------------
	
     1. Working in your vLab

	    -> Follow the instructions document and go to Windows server.
	    -> Windows server desktop has:
			1. A word document with user credentials and other instruction
			2. An icon of "Oracle VM virtualbox" to launch the lab VM

	    -> Click on the "Oracle VM virtualbox" to launch the lab 

		  -> Open a terminal and type "pyspark"
		  -> Launch Spyder IDE to write programs.


     2. Setting up your own PySpark environment on a local machine.

	-> Install "Anaconda Navigator" 
	-> Open an  Ananconda Terminal and pip install pyspark.

	-> If pip install is not working for you, you can use the instructions mentioned in the shared document.

    Spark Architecture
    ------------------

	1. Cluster Manager
		-> Jobs are submitted to CMs
		-> Allocates containers for lauching driver and executors on the cluster. 
		-> Spark supports multiple CMs
			-> local, standalone, YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes		

	2. Driver
		-> Master process
		-> Runs the SparkContext object
		-> Manages the user code and sends the tasks to the executors as per the code. 

		Deploy Modes:
		1. Client : default, driver runs on the client. 
		2. Cluster : driver runs on one of the nodes on the cluster.

	3. SparkContext
		-> Is an application context
		-> Starting point of execution
		-> Is the link between the driver and tasks running on the executors

	4. Executors
		-> receives the tasks from the Driver
		-> all tasks runs the same execution code but on different partitions of the data
		-> the status of tasks are reported to the driver.

	


    RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets)
    ------------------------------------
  
    -> RDD is the fundamental data abstraction of Spark.

    -> RDD is a collection of distributed in-memory partitions.
	-> A partition is a collection of objects. 

    -> RDDs are lazily evaluated
	-> Transformations only cause the lineage DAGs to be created. Does not cause executition	
	-> Action commands causes execution.

    -> RDDs are immmutable




   Creating RDDs
   -------------

	Three ways:

	1. Create an RDD from external data file

		rddFile = sc.textFile( "E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt", 4 )

	2. Create an RDD from programmatic data

		rdd1 = sc.parallelize( range(1, 100), 3 )

	3. By applying transformations on existing RDDs

		rddWords = rddFile.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(" "))


   RDD Operations
   --------------

    Two operations:

	1. Transformations
		-> Only create RDD linage DAGS
		-> Does not cause execution

	2. Actions
		-> Trigger execution of an RDD
		-> Generates output.



   RDD Lineage DAG
   ---------------

	rddFile = sc.textFile( "E:\\Spark\\wordcount.txt", 4 )
	Lineage of rddFile :  (4) rddFile -> sc.textFile

	rddWords = rddFile.flatMap(lambda x: x.split(" "))
	Lineage of rddWords :  (4) rddWords -> rddFile.flatMap -> sc.textFile

	rddPairs = rddWords.map(lambda x: (x, 1))
	Lineage of rddPairs :  (4) rddPairs -> rddWords.map -> rddFile.flatMap -> sc.textFile

	rddWc = rddPairs.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)		
	Lineage of rddWc :  (4) rddWc ->  rddPairs.reduceByKey -> rddWords.map -> rddFile.flatMap -> sc.textFile
